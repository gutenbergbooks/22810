    <p>
      It was the last house in Beauchamp Row, and it stood several rods away
      from its nearest neighbor. It was a pretty house in the daytime, but owing
      to its deep, sloping roof and small bediamonded windows it had a lonesome
      look at night, notwithstanding the crimson hall-light which shone through
      the leaves of its vine-covered doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ned Chivers lived in it with his six months&rsquo; married bride, and as he was
      both a busy fellow and a gay one there were many evenings when pretty
      Letty Chivers sat alone until near midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was of an uncomplaining spirit, however, and said little, though there
      were times when both the day and evening seemed very long and married
      life not altogether the paradise she had expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this evening&mdash;a memorable evening for her, the twenty-fourth of
      December, 1894&mdash;she had expected her husband to remain with her, for
      it was not only Christmas eve, but the night when, as manager of a large
      manufacturing concern, he brought up from New York the money with which to
      pay off the men on the next working day, and he never left her when there
      was any unusual amount of money in the house. But from the first glimpse
      she had of him coming up the road she knew she was to be disappointed in
      this hope, and, indignant, alarmed almost, at the prospect of a lonesome
      evening under these circumstances, she ran hastily down to the gate to
      meet him, crying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Ned, you look so troubled I know you have only come home for a
      hurried supper. But you cannot leave me to-night. Tennie&rdquo; (their only
      maid) &ldquo;has gone for a holiday, and I never can stay in this house alone
      with all that.&rdquo; She pointed to the small bag he carried, which, as she
      knew, was filled to bursting with bank notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He certainly looked troubled. It is hard to resist the entreaty in a young
      bride&rsquo;s uplifted face. But this time he could not help himself, and he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am dreadful sorry, but I must ride over to Fairbanks to-night. Mr.
      Pierson has given me an imperative order to conclude a matter of business
      there, and it is very important that it should be done. I should lose my
      position if I neglected the matter, and no one but Hasbrouck and Suffern
      knows that we keep the money in the house. I have always given out that I
      intrusted it to Hale&rsquo;s safe over night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I cannot stand it,&rdquo; she persisted. &ldquo;You have never left me on these
      nights. That is why I let Tennie go. I will spend the evening at The
      Larches, or, better still, call in Mr. and Mrs. Talcott to keep me
      company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But her husband did not approve of her going out or of her having company.
      The Larches was too far away, and as for Mr. and Mrs. Talcott, they were
      meddlesome people, whom he had never liked; besides, Mrs. Talcott was
      delicate, and the night threatened storm. It seemed hard to subject her to
      this ordeal, and he showed that he thought so by his manner, but, as
      circumstances were, she would have to stay alone, and he only hoped she
      would be brave and go to bed like a good girl, and think nothing about the
      money, which he would take care to put away in a very safe place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or,&rdquo; said he, kissing her downcast face, &ldquo;perhaps you would rather hide
      it yourself; women always have curious ideas about such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, let me hide it,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;The money, I mean, not the bag.
      Every one knows the bag. I should never dare to leave it in that.&rdquo; And
      begging him to unlock it, she began to empty it with a feverish haste that
      rather alarmed him, for he surveyed her anxiously and shook his head as if
      he dreaded the effects of this excitement upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But as he saw no way of averting it he confined himself to using such
      soothing words as were at his command, and then, humoring her weakness,
      helped her to arrange the bills in the place she had chosen, and
      restuffing the bag with old receipts till it acquired its former
      dimensions, he put a few bills on top to make the whole look natural, and,
      laughing at her white face, relocked the bag and put the key back in his
      pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, dear; a notable scheme and one that should relieve your mind
      entirely!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;If any one should attempt burglary in my absence and
      should succeed in getting into a house as safely locked as this will be
      when I leave it, then trust to their being satisfied when they see this
      booty, which I shall hide where I always hide it&mdash;in the cupboard
      over my desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And when will you be back?&rdquo; she murmured, trembling in spite of herself
      at these preparations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By one o&rsquo;clock if possible. Certainly by two.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And our neighbors go to bed at ten,&rdquo; she murmured. But the words were
      low, and she was glad he did not hear them, for if it was his duty to obey
      the orders he had received, then it was her duty to meet the position in
      which it left her as bravely as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      At supper she was so natural that his face rapidly brightened, and it was
      with quite an air of cheerfulness that he rose at last to lock up the
      house and make such preparations as were necessary for his dismal ride
      over the mountains to Fairbanks. She had the supper dishes to wash up in
      Tennie&rsquo;s absence, and as she was a busy little housewife she found herself
      singing a snatch of song as she passed back and forth from dining-room to
      kitchen. He heard it, too, and smiled to himself as he bolted the windows
      on the ground floor and examined the locks of the three lower doors, and
      when he finally came into the kitchen with his greatcoat on to give her
      his final kiss, he had but one parting injunction to urge, and that was
      that she should lock the front door after him and then forget the whole
      matter till she heard his double knock at midnight.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled and held up her ingenuous face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful of yourself,&rdquo; she murmured. &ldquo;I hate this dark ride for you,
      and on such a night too.&rdquo; And she ran with him to the door to look out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is certainly very dark,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m to have one of Brown&rsquo;s
      safest horses. Do not worry about me. I shall do well enough, and so will
      you, too, or you are not the plucky little woman I have always thought
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed, but there was a choking sound in her voice that made him look
      at her again. But at sight of his anxiety she recovered herself, and
      pointing to the clouds said earnestly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is going to snow. Be careful as you ride by the gorge, Ned; it is very
      deceptive there in a snowstorm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he vowed that it would not snow before morning, and giving her one
      final embrace he dashed down the path toward Brown&rsquo;s livery stable. &ldquo;Oh,
      what is the matter with me?&rdquo; she murmured to herself as his steps died out
      in the distance. &ldquo;I never knew I was such a coward.&rdquo; And she paused for a
      moment, looking up and down the road, as if in despite of her husband&rsquo;s
      command she had the desperate idea of running away to some neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But she was too loyal for that, and smothering a sigh she retreated into
      the house. As she did so the first flakes fell of the storm that was not
      to have come till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took her an hour to get her kitchen in order, and nine o&rsquo;clock struck
      before she was ready to sit down. She had been so busy she had not noticed
      how the wind had increased or how rapidly the snow was falling. But when
      she went to the front door for another glance up and down the road she
      started back, appalled at the fierceness of the gale and at the great pile
      of snow that had already accumulated on the doorstep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Too delicate to breast such a wind, she saw herself robbed of her last
      hope of any companionship, and sighing heavily she locked and bolted the
      door for the night and went back into her little sitting-room, where a
      great fire was burning. Here she sat down, and determined, now that she
      must pass the evening alone, to do it as cheerfully as possible, and so
      began to sew. &ldquo;Oh, what a Christmas eve!&rdquo; she thought, and a picture of
      other homes rose before her eyes, homes in which husbands sat by wives and
      brothers by sisters, and a great wave of regret poured over her and a
      longing for something, she hardly dared say what, lest her unhappiness
      should acquire a sting that would leave traces beyond the passing moment.
      The room in which she sat was the only one on the ground floor except the
      dining-room and kitchen. It therefore was used both as parlor and
      sitting-room, and held not only her piano, but her husband&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Communicating with it was the tiny dining-room. Between the two, however,
      was an entry leading to a side entrance. A lamp was in this entry, and she
      had left it burning, as well as the one in the kitchen, that the house
      might look cheerful and as if all the family were at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was looking toward this entry and wondering whether it was the mist
      made by her tears that made it look so dismally dark to her when there
      came a faint sound from the door at its further end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing that her husband must have taken peculiar pains with the
      fastenings of this door, as it was the one toward the woods and therefore
      most accessible to wayfarers, she sat where she was, with all her
      faculties strained to listen. But no further sound came from that
      direction, and after a few minutes of silent terror she was allowing
      herself to believe that she had been deceived by her fears when she
      suddenly heard the same sound at the kitchen door, followed by a muffled
      knock.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened now in good earnest, but still alive to the fact that the
      intruder was as likely to be a friend as a foe, she stepped to the door,
      and with her hand on the lock stooped and asked boldly enough who was
      there. But she received no answer, and more affected by this unexpected
      silence than by the knock she had heard she recoiled farther and farther
      till not only the width of the kitchen, but the dining-room also, lay
      between her and the scene of her alarm, when to her utter confusion the
      noise shifted again to the side of the house, and the door she thought so
      securely fastened, swung violently open as if blown in by a fierce gust,
      and she saw precipitated into the entry the burly figure of a man covered
      with snow and shaking with the violence of the storm that seemed at once
      to fill the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her first thought was that it was her husband come back, but before she
      could clear her eyes from the cloud of snow which had entered with him he
      had thrown off his outer covering and she found herself face to face with
      a man in whose powerful frame and cynical visage she saw little to comfort
      her and much to surprise and alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh!&rdquo; was his coarse and rather familiar greeting. &ldquo;A hard night, missus!
      Enough to drive any man indoors. Pardon the liberty, but I couldn&rsquo;t wait
      for you to lift the latch; the wind drove me right in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was&mdash;was not the door locked?&rdquo; she feebly asked, thinking he must
      have staved it in with his foot, that looked only too well fitted for such
      a task.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose you&rsquo;re too hospitable for that.&rdquo; And
      his eyes passed from her face to the comfortable firelight shining through
      the sitting-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it refuge you want?&rdquo; she demanded, suppressing as much as possible all
      signs of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure, missus&mdash;what else! A man can&rsquo;t live in a gale like that,
      specially after a tramp of twenty miles or more. Shall I shut the door for
      you?&rdquo; he asked, with a mixture of bravado and good nature that frightened
      her more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will shut it,&rdquo; she replied, with a half notion of escaping this
      sinister stranger by a flight through the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      But one glance into the swirling snow-storm deterred her, and making the
      best of the alarming situation, she closed the door, but did not lock it,
      being more afraid now of what was inside the house than of anything left
      to threaten her from without.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man, whose clothes were dripping with water, watched her with a
      cynical smile, and then, without any invitation, entered the dining-room,
      crossed it and moved toward the kitchen fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ugh! ugh! But it is warm here!&rdquo; he cried, his nostrils dilating with an
      animal-like enjoyment that in itself was repugnant to her womanly
      delicacy. &ldquo;Do you know, missus, I shall have to stay here all night? Can&rsquo;t
      go out in that gale again; not such a fool.&rdquo; Then with a sly look at her
      trembling form and white face he insinuatingly added, &ldquo;All alone, missus?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The suddenness with which this was put, together with the leer that
      accompanied it, made her start. Alone? Yes, but should she acknowledge it?
      Would it not be better to say that her husband was up-stairs. The man
      evidently saw the struggle going on in her mind, for he chuckled to
      himself and called out quite boldly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind, missus; it&rsquo;s all right. Just give me a bit of cold meat and a
      cup of tea or something, and we&rsquo;ll be very comfortable together. You&rsquo;re a
      slender slip of a woman to be minding a house like this. I&rsquo;ll keep you
      company if you don&rsquo;t mind, leastwise until the storm lets up a bit, which
      ain&rsquo;t likely for some hours to come. Rough night, missus, rough night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect my husband home at any time,&rdquo; she hastened to say. And thinking
      she saw a change in the man&rsquo;s countenance at this she put on quite an air
      of sudden satisfaction and bounded toward the front of the house. &ldquo;There!
      I think I hear him now,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her motive was to gain time, and if possible to obtain the opportunity of
      shifting the money from the place where she had first put it into another
      and safer one. &ldquo;I want to be able,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;of swearing that I have
      no money with me in this house. If I can only get it into my apron I will
      drop it outside the door into the snowbank. It will be as safe there as in
      the bank it came from.&rdquo; And dashing into the sitting-room she made a feint
      of dragging down a shawl from a screen, while she secretly filled her
      skirt with the bills which had been put between some old pamphlets on the
      bookshelves.
    </p>
    <p>
      She could hear the man grumbling in the kitchen, but he did not follow her
      front, and taking advantage of the moment&rsquo;s respite from his none too
      encouraging presence she unbarred the door and cheerfully called out her
      husband&rsquo;s name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ruse was successful. She was enabled to fling the notes where the
      falling flakes would soon cover them from sight, and feeling more
      courageous, now that the money was out of the house, she went slowly back,
      saying she had made a mistake, and that it was the wind she had heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man gave a gruff but knowing guffaw and then resumed his watch over
      her, following her steps as she proceeded to set him out a meal, with a
      persistency that reminded her of a tiger just on the point of springing.
      But the inviting look of the viands with which she was rapidly setting the
      table soon distracted his attention, and allowing himself one grunt of
      satisfaction, he drew up a chair and set himself down to what to him was
      evidently a most savory repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No beer? No ale? Nothing o&rsquo; that sort, eh? Don&rsquo;t keep a bar?&rdquo; he growled,
      as his teeth closed on a huge hunk of bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, wishing she had a little cold poison bottled up in a
      tight-looking jug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but tea,&rdquo; she smiled, astonished at her own ease of manner in the
      presence of this alarming guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s have that,&rdquo; he grumbled, taking the bowl she handed him, with
      an odd look that made her glad to retreat to the other side of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest listen to the howling wind,&rdquo; he went on between the huge mouthfuls
      of bread and cheese with which he was gorging himself. &ldquo;But we&rsquo;re very
      comfortable, we two! We don&rsquo;t mind the storm, do we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Shocked by his familiarity and still more moved by the look of mingled
      inquiry and curiosity with which his eyes now began to wander over the
      walls and cupboards, she took an anxious step toward the side of the house
      looking toward her neighbors, and lifting one of the shades, which had all
      been religiously pulled down, she looked out. A swirl of snow-flakes alone
      confronted her. She could neither see her neighbors, nor could she be seen
      by them. A shout from her to them would not be heard. She was as
      completely isolated as if the house stood in the center of a desolate
      western plain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no trust but in God,&rdquo; she murmured as she came from the window.
      And, nerved to meet her fate, she crossed to the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now half-past ten. Two hours and a half must elapse before her
      husband could possibly arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      She set her teeth at the thought and walked resolutely into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you done?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he leered. &ldquo;Do you want me to wash the dishes? I kin, and I
      will.&rdquo; And he actually carried his plate and cup to the sink, where he
      turned the water upon them with another loud guffaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only his fancy would take him into the pantry,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;I could
      shut and lock the door upon him and hold him prisoner till Ned gets back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his fancy ended its flight at the sink, and before her hopes had fully
      subsided he was standing on the threshold of the sitting-room door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pretty here,&rdquo; he exclaimed, allowing his eye to rove again over
      every hiding-place within sight. &ldquo;I wonder now&rdquo;&mdash;He stopped. His
      glance had fallen on the cupboard over her husband&rsquo;s desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked, anxious to break the thread of his thought, which was
      only too plainly mirrored in his eager countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He started, dropped his eyes, and turning looked at her with a momentary
      fierceness. But, as she did not let her own glance quail, but continued to
      look at him with what she meant for a smile on her pale lips, he subdued
      this outward manifestation of passion, and, chuckling to hide his
      embarrassment, began backing into the entry, leering in evident enjoyment
      of the fears he caused, with what she felt was a most horrible smile. Once
      in the hall, he hesitated, however, for a long time; then he slowly went
      toward the garment he had dropped on entering and stooping, drew from
      underneath its folds a wicked-looking stick. Giving a kick to the coat,
      which sent it into a remote corner, he bestowed upon her another smile,
      and still carrying the stick went slowly and reluctantly away into the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, God Almighty, help me!&rdquo; was her prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing for her to do now but endure, so throwing herself into a
      chair, she tried to calm the beating of her heart and summon up courage
      for the struggle which she felt was before her. That he had come to rob
      and only waited to take her off her guard she now felt certain, and
      rapidly running over in her mind all the expedients of self-defense
      possible to one in her situation, she suddenly remembered the pistol which
      Ned kept in his desk. Oh, why had she not thought of it before! Why had
      she let herself grow mad with terror when here, within reach of her hand,
      lay such a means of self-defense? With a feeling of joy (she had always
      hated pistols before and scolded Ned when he bought this one) she started
      to her feet and slid her hand into the drawer. But it came back empty. Ned
      had taken the weapon away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, a surge of the bitterest feeling she had ever experienced
      passed over her; then she called reason to her aid and was obliged to
      acknowledge that the act was but natural, and that from his standpoint he
      was much more likely to need it than herself. But the disappointment,
      coming so soon after hope, unnerved her, and she sank back in her chair,
      giving herself up for lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long she sat there with her eyes on the door, through which she
      momentarily expected her assailant to reappear, she never knew. She was
      conscious only of a sort of apathy that made movement difficult and even
      breathing a task. In vain she tried to change her thoughts. In vain she
      tried to follow her husband in fancy over the snow-covered roads and into
      the gorge of the mountains. Imagination failed her at this point. Do what
      she would, all was misty in her mind&rsquo;s eye, and she could not see that
      wandering image. There was blankness between his form and her, and no life
      or movement anywhere but here in the scene of her terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes were on a strip of rug that covered the entry floor, and so
      strange was the condition of her mind that she found herself mechanically
      counting the tassels that finished its edge, growing wroth over one that
      was worn, till she hated that sixth tassel and mentally determined that if
      she ever outlived this night she would strip them all off and be done with
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wind had lessened, but the air had grown cooler and the snow made a
      sharp sound where it struck the panes. She felt it falling, though she had
      cut off all view of it. It seemed to her that a pall was settling over the
      world and that she would soon be smothered under its folds. Meanwhile no
      sound came from the kitchen, only that dreadful sense of a doom creeping
      upon her&mdash;a sense that grew in intensity till she found herself
      watching for the shadow of that lifted stick on the wall of the entry, and
      almost imagined she saw the tip of it appearing, when without any
      premonition, that fatal side door again blew in and admitted another man
      of so threatening an aspect that she succumbed instantly before him and
      forgot all her former fears in this new terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second intruder was a negro of powerful frame and lowering aspect, and
      as he came for-ward and stood in the doorway there was observable in his
      fierce and desperate countenance no attempt at the insinuation of the
      other, only a fearful resolution that made her feel like a puppet before
      him, and drove her, almost without her volition, to her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Money? Is it money you want?&rdquo; was her desperate greeting. &ldquo;If so, here&rsquo;s
      my purse and here are my rings and watch. Take them and go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the stolid wretch did not even stretch out his hands. His eyes went
      beyond her, and the mingled anxiety and resolve which he displayed would
      have cowed a stouter heart than that of this poor woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep de trash,&rdquo; he growled. &ldquo;I want de company&rsquo;s money. You &lsquo;ve got it&mdash;two
      thousand dollars. Show me where it is, that&rsquo;s all, and I won&rsquo;t trouble you
      long after I close on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not in the house,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I swear it is not in the house.
      Do you think Mr. Chivers would leave me here alone with two thousand
      dollars to guard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the negro, swearing that she lied, leaped into the room, and tearing
      open the cupboard above her husband&rsquo;s desk, seized the bag from the corner
      where they had put it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He brought it in this,&rdquo; he muttered, and tried to force the bag open, but
      finding this impossible he took out a heavy knife and cut a big hole in
      its side. Instantly there fell out the pile of old receipts with which
      they had stuffed it, and seeing these he stamped with rage, and flinging
      them in one great handful at her rushed to the drawers below, emptied
      them, and, finding nothing, attacked the bookcase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The money is somewhere here. You can&rsquo;t fool me,&rdquo; he yelled. &ldquo;I saw the
      spot your eyes lit on when I first came into the room. Is it behind these
      books?&rdquo; he growled, pulling them out and throwing them helter-skelter over
      the floor. &ldquo;Women is smart in the hiding business. Is it behind these
      books, I say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been, or rather had been placed between the books, but she had
      taken them away, as we know, and he soon began to realise that his search
      was bringing him nothing, for leaving the bookcase he gave the books one
      kick, and seizing her by the arm, shook her with a murderous glare on his
      strange and distorted features.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the money?&rdquo; he hissed. &ldquo;Tell me, or you are a goner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised his heavy fist. She crouched and all seemed over, when, with a
      rush and cry, a figure dashed between them and he fell, struck down by the
      very stick she had so long been expecting to see fall upon her own head.
      The man who had been her terror for hours had at the moment of need acted
      as her protector.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      She must have fainted, but if so, her unconsciousness was but momentary,
      for when she again recognized her surroundings she found the tramp still
      standing over her adversary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mind, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, with an air of humbleness she
      certainly had not seen in him before, &ldquo;but I think the man&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo; And he
      stirred with his foot the heavy figure before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no, no!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That would be too fearful. He&rsquo;s shocked,
      stunned; you cannot have killed him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the tramp was persistent. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m &lsquo;fraid I have,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I done it
      before, and it&rsquo;s been the same every time. But I couldn&rsquo;t see a man of
      that color frighten a lady like you. My supper was too warm in me, ma&rsquo;am.
      Shall I throw him outside the house?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, and then, &ldquo;No; let us first be sure there is no life in
      him.&rdquo; And, hardly knowing what she did, she stooped down and peered into
      the glassy eyes of the prostrate man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she turned pale&mdash;no, not pale, but ghastly, and cowering
      back, shook so that the tramp, into whose features a certain refinement
      had passed since he had acted as her protector, thought she had discovered
      life in those set orbs, and was stooping down to make sure that this was
      so, when he saw her suddenly lean forward and, impetuously plunging her
      hand into the negro&rsquo;s throat, tear open the shirt and give one look at his
      bared breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;O God! O God!&rdquo; she moaned, and lifting the head in her two hands she gave
      the motionless features a long and searching look. &ldquo;Water!&rdquo; she cried.
      &ldquo;Bring water.&rdquo; But before the now obedient tramp could respond, she had
      torn off the woolly wig disfiguring the dead man&rsquo;s head, and seeing the
      blond curls beneath had uttered such a shriek that it rose above the gale
      and was heard by her distant neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the head and hair of her husband.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      They found out afterwards that he had contemplated this theft for months,
      that each and every precaution possible to a successful issue to this most
      daring undertaking had been made use of and that but for the unexpected
      presence in the house of the tramp, he would doubtless have not only
      extorted the money from his wife, but have so covered up the deed by a
      plausible <i>alibi</i> as to have retained her confidence and that of his
      employers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the tramp killed him out of sympathy for the defenseless woman or
      in rage at being disappointed in his own plans has never been determined.
      Mrs. Chivers herself thinks he was actuated by a rude sort of gratitude.
